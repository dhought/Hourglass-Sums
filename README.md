# Hourglass-Sums

Asks the user for 6 rows of 6 integers as input to create a 6x6 array.
The function then iterates through the array, identifying each possible
hourglass shape, and finds the sum of each one. Finally, the 
hourglass with the greatest sum is identified and the sum is displayed.

Ex:

Input:

[0 0 0 0 0 0]

[0 1 1 1 0 0]

[0 0 1 0 0 0]

[0 1 1 1 0 0]

[0 0 0 0 0 0]

[0 0 0 0 0 0]


In this example the 1s represent the hourglass shape and the output would be
7.
